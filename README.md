# Overview

This library provides a means to track the rolling maximum and minium of a stream of numbers (or anything IComparable) in O(1) time.

This has been benchmarked to be faster than the ascending minima algorithm.



Available on NuGet as package [`RollingWindowExtremes`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RollingWindowExtremes).
